                    <p>Artist Statement: 

                        The human body, a boundless source of expression, growth, and survival, has been an enduring wellspring of innovation. Its influence extends beyond the realm of the physical, permeating our creative endeavors throughout history. Within the intricate choreography of our movements, we discover the origins of our narratives and experiences, foundational elements that define us as profoundly as our bones, vessels, and organs.In our exploration of the world, we have uncovered a profound means of preserving and revisiting our stories—through drawing. This practice not only allows us to transcend cultural boundaries but also serves as a bridge between seemingly disparate disciplines. Drawing rituals, enriched by cultural values and customs, facilitate social interactions by weaving connections among individuals, objects, and spaces.Within the realm of my artistic expression, I cordially invite you to experience "Traversing Kata: Body Movements as Drawing Paths." In this captivating journey, I delve into the world of kata paths, where the ancient art of movement intertwines seamlessly with the timeless craft of drawing. These paths, embodied by the grace of Nijushiho, serve as both my canvas and inspiration, rekindling dialogues between performers, support staff, and the audience. As I meticulously trace the repetitive, intricate movements of these performances, I find myself echoing experiences and interactions of bygone eras. Through this intricate dance of movement and artistry, I breathe vitality into memories, and experiences, drawing them onto the very surface of time through the mesmerizing cadence of kata
